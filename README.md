# Lupo

Lupo is a basic static website generator written in Bash. It will
copy a hierarchy of files and folders, converting any markdown files
into HTML files.

Once configured, you can write / edit pages locally; build the new
pages, or do a full website build; then deploy straight to your server.

You can even run the `live` command and Lupo will watch your source files 
for changes and automatically convert and push those files to your 
remote server.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/davidpeach/lupo
cd ./lupo
./install
cd ../
rm -rf ./lupo
```

## Dependancies
- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) is **required** for convert markdown files into html. This is quite a hefty requirement along with its own dependancies, I am looking for alternatives.
- [rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/) is **required** for using the `push` command.
- [inotifywait](https://man.archlinux.org/man/inotifywait.1) is **required** for using the `watch` command.
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) is **required** for using the `serve` command.

## Usage

Examples are for Linux-based systems, but can be altered for Mac / Windows based ones.

## Creating your first page
1. Install `lupo` as per the directions above.
2. run `mkdir my-website && cd my-website`.
3. Run `lupo init`.
4. Create a file in your `src` directory called `index.md`.
5. Add the following content to it:
```markdown
---
title: My Website
---

Welcome to my website!
```
6. Run `lupo build` from the root of your project.
7. A new file should now be present at `./html/index.html`.
8. That html directory is the one to deploy to a remote server.

## Viewing your website locally
Lupo comes with the `serve` command. This command will leverage Docker, if present on your system, to start an nginx container and make your local lupo site available at `http://localhost:7777`.

## Creating a full website
The steps shown above, for creating your first page, can be used to create any size website.

Granted, I've not built this tool with a view to it being able to replace a huge website in some other framework / system.

This is just a tool I made for myself that I want to make available for other people to use at their leisure ðŸ’• .

Any website structure you create in your `src` directory will be replicated in the outputed `html` directory.
Images / CSS / JavaScript files will be copied across as they are in your source directory - no build steps.
Your markdown files will be converted to html before being copied across.

for example:

```
src/
    |-- index.md
    |-- style.css
    |-- script.js
    |-- about/ 
            |-- index.md
            |-- me.jpg
    |-- blog/
            |-- my-post-one.md
            |-- my-post-two.md
```
will create:
```
html/
    |-- index.html
    |-- style.css
    |-- script.js
    |-- about/ 
            |-- index.html
            |-- me.jpg
    |-- blog/
            |-- my-post-one.html
            |-- my-post-two.html
```

You are completely free to structure your website exactly how you want to.

## Deploying to your remote server

You can set Lupo up to easily deploy to a remote server that you control.

It uses `rsync` on your system to accomplish this.

You need to tell Lupo where to send your files.

This is done by setting the following configuration items in your `.config` file will allow you to do this:

- remote_user - This is the user who owns the directory where the html files will be sent to.
- ssh_identity_key - This is the path to the private key file on your computer that pairs with the public key on your remote server.
- domain_name - The domain name pointing to your server.
- remote_directory - The full path to the directory where your html files are served from on your server.

You can use the `config` command to run through the step by step questions to build your configuration file.

Once your configuration is done you can use the following command to push your built files directly over to your server.

```
lupo push
```

## Watching for incremental changes

As you are writing your files, you can tell lupo to watch your files and auto re-build the output html as you save files.

There are currently big limitations on this. For instance it wont yet recognise new files created _after_ you start the watch command.

Run the following command to start watching your existing files:

```
lupo watch
```

## Pushing live changes on save

```
lupo live
```
